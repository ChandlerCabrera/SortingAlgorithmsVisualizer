# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project was done to accomplish two things:
1. Learn Python
2. Refresh my knowledge on sorting algorithms

This app 'visualizes' sorting algorithms by representing the array as a bar graph. It makes the sort easier to follow by highlighting the important elements, and providing captions at each step.
